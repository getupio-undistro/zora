# Introduction

## What is Zora?

Zora is a multi-cluster scan that helps you to identify potential issues and vulnerabilities 
in your kubernetes clusters in a centralized way, ensuring that the recommended best practices are in place.

Follow these steps to get started with Zora:

1. [Install Zora](/install) in a cluster, aka [Management Cluster](/glossary#management-cluster) 

2. [Prepare the target cluster](/target-cluster) by creating a service account and generating a kubeconfig

3. [Connect the target cluster to Zora](/connect-cluster)

4. [Configure a scan for the target cluster](/cluster-scan)

5. After a successful scan [checkout the potential reported issues](/cluster-scan#list-cluster-issues)

All the information about these steps are detailed throughout this documentation.
