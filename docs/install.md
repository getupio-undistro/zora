# Install

Zora requires an existing Kubernetes cluster accessible via `kubectl`.
After the installation process this cluster will be your [management cluster](/glossary#management-cluster)
with the Zora components installed. 
So it is recommended to keep it separated from any application workload.

## Setup Requirements

Zora's management cluster requires these programs in order to be installed and configured:

- Kubernetes >= 1.21.0
- Helm >= 3.4.0
- Kubectl
- Awk
- Cat
- POSIX shell


## Install with Helm

1. To install Zora using [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/) follow these commands:

```shell
helm repo add undistro https://charts.undistro.io --force-update
helm repo update undistro
helm upgrade --install zora undistro/zora \
  -n zora-system \
  --create-namespace --wait
```

!!! info
    The Helm chart repository has been updated from `https://registry.undistro.io/chartrepo/library` to `https://charts.undistro.io`.

    The `--force-update` flag is needed to update the repository URL.

These commands deploy Zora to the Kubernetes cluster.
[This section](helm-chart.md) lists the parameters
that can be configured during installation.

## Access to the UI

The output of `helm install` and `helm upgrade` commands
contains instructions to access Zora UI based on the provided parameters.

You can get the instructions anytime by running: 

```shell
helm get notes zora -n zora-system
```

## Uninstall

```shell
helm delete zora -n zora-system
kubectl delete namespace zora-system
```
